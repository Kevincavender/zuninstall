# Script for installing zunzun website for personal use
Install VirtualBox with Ubuntu 16.01 LTS (what works for me)
1) Make VM with settings:
    
      at least 20 GB of space
    
      about 90% CPU utilization for max speed
    
      network settings on bridged adapter
2) Install Ubuntu Server (default settings should be fine)
3) run commands:

`git clone 'https://github.com/Kevincavender/zuninstall'`

`cd zuninstall`

`chmod +x zunzun_install`

`./zunzun_install`
